# OpenDCS SHEF Parser and Generator library

The purpose of this project is to implement a pure Java version of a complete SHEF parser to make handling SHEF
data in OpenDCS easier.

Eventually create tools to generate SHEF message.

The parser is being created with an ANTLR4 grammar. This grammar will kept clean of code to be suitable for use in any programming language;
however this project will focus on Java.
